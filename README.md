For managing and tracking study breaks when working.

This is for my personal use when working. It tracks the amount of time I spend on breaks vs work. With keyboard shortcuts and the python-notify library, I can quickly hit a shortcut in the middle of any activity and update the record or have the current status pop up on my screen.
